MyDocs is an online document sharing application. The users needs to login with their username and password to use the services of the application. MyDocs team have approached you to create the login module for the application.The users must login through a login form. If login is success they should be forwarded to the success page which prints a greeting message “Hello <user>” where <user> is the username entered by the user. The user name/password should be admin/admin for successfully login into the application. If the username/password is incorrect the user should be forwarded to error page with the error message “username (or) password is incorrect”. 

Design:
Design the components as stated below.

Login.html :  Should have two text fields 
	User Name: Text Field
	Password:  Password Field
LoginController : The login servlet should process the login action and validate the user name and password. (Hint : Use doPost to handle the login action).
	If the user name and password is admin/admin the request redirected to Success page.
	If user name and password is wrong the request to be forwarded to the Error page.
success.jsp : This is the success page for the application which should display the greetings “Hello <user>”
